# Malware-ReverseShell
## Description:
+ In this project, by using socket programming in the client and server topology, the way a virus works is simulated.
In the implementation of this project, Linux bash commands have been used; So it must run on this operating system.

+ The virus file is executed on the client or victim system and connects to the server or attacker. By connecting the input and output of its shell to the server, the virus gives it unauthorized access to execute the commands it wants in the client system and receive the output. Also, the server can download a file from the client system or upload a file to it.

+ Any number of clients can be connected to the server and managed by it. The server and clients have used the localhost IP address, which you can change if needed.

## Hints:
+ You can move between the directories of the client system through the server with the ```cd``` command.

+ The server has the ability to manage clients, for example, giving desired names to each of them or closing the connection of a specific client.
  
+ The server can send a specific command simultaneously to all the clients that are connected to it and view the outputs.
  
+ For example, you can use the following command to download a file from the client system:
  
```>>DOWNLOAD  <filepath>/filename.txt  <destination path>```

+ For example, you can use the following command to upload a file from your system to the client system:
  
```>>UPLOAD  <filepath>/filename.txt  <destination path>```
